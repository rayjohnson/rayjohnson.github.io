      <description>I am a software engineering executive.  I build products, I build teams, I build business value!  Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a SVP of Engineering currently living in sunny southern california. I got my BS in Computer Science at George Washington University in D.C. and my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA.
Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a fairly large company but also three different start-ups. While I like to keep my hands dirty, I mostly spend my time building and managing teams of engineers, designers, quality assuance folks, and sometimes product and project managers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had an Apple TV since the first version. Apple makes simple products and for when I&amp;rsquo;m kicking my feet up and relaxing with the TV the one thing I want is for it to be simple. I remember getting my first Tivo and how it changed my life forever! Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many different products - but I knew apple would make it simple. They did! I still play with things like Kodi on occasion - but nothing beats the Apple laid back experience.</description>
